# Analysis of Biases in Algorithms using Facial Metrics

## Introduction
This project explores biases in algorithms through the analysis of facial metrics. Using the Chicago Face Database, it investigates demographic data, focusing on attributes like ethnicity and gender, and how these might influence algorithmic decisions.

## How to Compile and Run
To compile and run the code in this project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/WynnieRaquel/DataScienceCapstone
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
cd DataScienceCapstone
3. **Install Required Packages:**
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn imbalanced-learn scipy
4. **Running the Script:**
python my_analysis.py

## Required Software and Packages
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, along with the following packages: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn, and SciPy.

## Dataset Information
This project utilizes the Chicago Face Database (CFD). The CFD offers high-resolution, standardized photographs of male and female faces of various ethnicities. It includes extensive norming data, covering physical attributes and subjective ratings.

### Database Sets
- **CFD:** Main set with images of 597 individuals.
- **CFD-MR:** Includes 88 individuals with multiracial ancestry.
- **CFD-INDIA:** Contains 142 individuals recruited in Delhi, India.

### Terms of Use
The CFD is available for non-commercial scientific research. Any use of the database materials should cite the appropriate sources, as detailed on the [Chicago Face Database website](https://www.chicagofaces.org/).
